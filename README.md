# How to build/deploy
This is mainly for Ben in the future, given he's probably going to forget how to build this website. The website is built using [hexo](https://hexo.io) and thus relies on hexo commands to build/deploy. You'll first need to make sure that the hexo command line tools are installed on your system.

Once they're installed, you can run `hexo generate` to build the website in the public folder. If you want to host the website locally for testing, you can run `hexo server`.
